        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hi, I’m Ben Bradford, a 14-year-old technical theatre enthusiast with a passion for stage management and all things behind the scenes. I’ve been involved in technical theatre for several years now, specializing in stage management, lighting, and sound design. My goal is to ensure that every production I work on runs smoothly, helping bring creative visions to life with precision and care.

            Whether it's managing a rehearsal, designing the perfect lighting setup, or ensuring the sound is just right, I strive to create a seamless experience for both the cast and crew. I’m always eager to take on new projects and challenges, learning and growing along the way.
            
            In addition to my work in theatre, I also enjoy collaborating with other theatre makers and sharing my knowledge with those just starting out in the field. I’m excited about the future of technical theatre and am always looking for opportunities to expand my skills and contribute to new productions.
            
            Feel free to browse my website to learn more about my work or to get in touch!
